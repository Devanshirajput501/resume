        Experience in this company:
        + ICLSSTA
            - Solely developed a framework, which develop and evaluate unsupervised learning solution in much depth and this from a single config file.
            - *Tags: Framework, Clustering, Anomaly, Outlier, Conceptual Drift Detection, Ensembling, Support all Dimension reduction, Anomaly, and Clustering Algorithm from Sklearn, Add. Custom Algorithm*

        + Adaptive Action Taking (AAT)
            - Developed a generalized module named which makes use of reinforcement learning to automatically take action on incoming traffic on the web property.
            - *Tags: Reinforcement Learning, Multi-Armed Bandit, Smart handling of Business Limits, Self-Adjusting* 
        + Deep Behaviour Analysis (IDBA)
            - Partially developed a module named Intent based, which utilizes LSTM to yield encoded features and scores that are used with supervised, anomaly and clustering.
            - Tags: RNN, Auto-Encoder, Semi-Supervised Learning, Sequence Based Detection, Deep Learning 
        + Threshold Online Reinforcement (ThOR)
            - Helped developed a module named, which makes utilizes online learning to develop a probability score distribution over of isotonic regression for action taking.
            - Tags: Isotonic Regression, Online Learning, Self-Adjusting, Smart handling of Business Limits 
        +  - Developed and implemented end to end machine and reinforce learning based solutions using ICLSSTA-AAT, IDBA-ICLSSTA-AAT, & IDBA-ThOR
